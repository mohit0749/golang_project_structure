# Go Project Structure

for more details info please refer : https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout


## Go Directories

### `/cmd`

Main applications for this project.

The directory name for each application should match the name of the executable you want to have (e.g., `/cmd/myapp`).

Don't put a lot of code in the application directory. If you think the code can be imported and used in other projects, then it should live in the `/pkg` directory. If the code is not reusable or if you don't want others to reuse it, put that code in the `/internal` directory. You'll be surprised what others will do, so be explicit about your intentions!

It's common to have a small `main` function that imports and invokes the code from the `/internal` and `/pkg` directories and nothing else.

### `/internal`

Private application and library code. This is the code you don't want others importing in their applications or libraries. Note that this layout pattern is enforced by the Go compiler itself. You can have more than one `internal` directory at any level of your project tree. The `internal` directory is a better way to ensure your private packages are not importable because it's enforced by Go.

### `/pkg`

Library code that's ok to use by external applications (e.g., `/pkg/mypubliclib`). Other projects will import these libraries expecting them to work.

## Common Application Directories

### `/files/etc/testproject/configs`

Configuration file eg. staging.yaml, prod.yaml .

### `/files/etc/testproject/init`

System init (systemd, upstart, sysv) and process manager/supervisor (runit, supervisord) configs.

### `/scripts`

Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations.

## Directories You Shouldn't Have

### `/src`

Some Go projects do have a `src` folder, but it usually happens when the devs came from the Java world where it's a common pattern. If you can help yourself try not to adopt this Java pattern. You really don't want your Go code or Go projects to look like Java :-)

Don't confuse the project level `/src` directory with the `/src` directory Go uses for its workspaces as described in [`How to Write Go Code`](https://golang.org/doc/code.html). The `$GOPATH` environment variable points to your (current) workspace (by default it points to `$HOME/go` on non-windows systems). This workspace includes the top level `/pkg`, `/bin` and `/src` directories. Your actual project ends up being a sub-directory under `/src`, so if you have the `/src` directory in your project the project path will look like this: `/some/path/to/workspace/src/your_project/src/your_code.go`. Note that with Go 1.11 it's possible to have your project outside of your `GOPATH`, but it still doesn't mean it's a good idea to use this layout pattern.
